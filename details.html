                <h3>What Next?</h3>
                <p>
                    An application is required prior to adoption. Complete our <a href="">application</a> and we'll be
                    in touch shortly.
                    Applying for a cat or kitten doesn't obligate you in any way!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adoption fee is $125/kitten or $200 for two. The adoption of 2 kittens is always encouraged,
                    particularly if a significant amount of 'alone time' is expected for the kitten.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Where do They Come From?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our cats and kittens are rescued from at-risk situations such as animal control facilities and
                    abandonment. They have been nurtured in an in-home foster environment and have had consistent,
                    loving socialization, usually from a very young age.
                    on working with CSS.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>The Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    All of our adoptable cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, have been treated for
                    worms and fleas, and are microchipped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did you know??? To have a cat spayed with a private vet in Johnson County costs about $300.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>What to Bring With You to the Adoption</h3>
                <p>
                    ​Bring a pet carrier or be prepared to purchase one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment can be made via cash, check, credit and debit cards, Paypal or our Donate Button on this
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adopter is required to electronically sign an adoption contract agreeing to provide health and
                    wellness essentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will provide the adopter with a copy of the cat's medical (including shot records).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cat's microchip will automatically be registered.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Which One?</h3>
                <p>
                    Think carefully about what you're looking for in a cat's personality. Don't pick a cat based on it's
                    color and fur length alone! The best kitten for you, might be the black, short-haired kitten in the
                    corner!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
                <p>
                    ​​Prepare for your new family member's homecoming by purchasing basic supplies such as:
                    A litter box (we recommend a box for each cat in the household). They can never be too big!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A scratching post (we recommend the Smart Cat post or similar, which can be found on Amazon for
                    $49.00. It's tall, sturdy and attractive).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bowls, one food bowl for each cat and a single water bowl is adequate. Avoid plastic (causes kitty
                    acne).
                    A variety of toys. Different cats like different types if tys, balls vs mice vs string toys, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will provide a sample of the food they're currently eating.
                </p>
